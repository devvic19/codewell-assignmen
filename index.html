     <h4>A Co-founder at one of the worlds largest communities.</h4> 
     <p4>The combined experience I have working at the top fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helpsme in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
        I am proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world’s largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.
        As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that’s holding you back is yourself.
        A quote I live perfectly illustrates what I mean. “How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn’t fail?” You’ve already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, its time to evaluate your skills and become a leader in something you’re passionate about.
        I’m happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.
        Interested in working with me?
        I’m active on all social media platforms listed below, but you can also email me and I will get back to you within 24-48 hours
